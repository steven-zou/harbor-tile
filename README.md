# harbor-tile
Project to build the PCF Ops Manager tile for Harbor based on Harbor bosh release.

**NOTES: Tile for Harbor is still under development. It's very unstable and may be not usable some time.**

## Package
[Tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-structure.html) in this project is built based on the [Harbor](https://github.com/vmware/harbor) [bosh](https://bosh.io) [release](https://github.com/steven-zou/harbor-bosh-release) created before.

```
packages:
- name: harbor
  type: bosh-release
  path: resources/habo.tgz
```

## Setup DEV environment
### Tile Generator
Pivotal recommends using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to setup the development environment. Install the **tile-generator** in the virtual environment created by virtualenv.
```
//create env
virtualenv -p /usr/local/python tile-generator-env

//activate env
source tile-generator-env/bin/activate

//install tile-generator
pip install tile-generator
```

### Pivotal Ops Manager
If you want to setup your own Ops Manager environment to validate the tile, you can follow the document below to deploy Ops Manager on vSphere (For other IaaS platform, please refer the Pivotal document).

* [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/deploying-vm.html)
* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/vsphere-config.html)

## Build and Test
Use the following command to initialize tile project if not create yet.
```
cd YOUR-PROD-DIRECTORY
tile init

```

**NOTES:To avoid keeping too large files in this repository, the Harbor BOSH release tarball this tile required is not pushed here. So before building the tile, you need to first create the Harbor BOSH release tarball if you don't have it in hands.**

Create Harbor BOSH release with tarball and put it under the resource folder. If tarball name changed, don't forget to change the release reference in the tile.yml.
```
git clone https://gitlab.eng.vmware.com/harbor/habo.git

cd habo

#--force create dev release, --final create formal release
bosh create-release --name harbor-bosh-release --version <new version> --tarball=<tarball path and name> --[force/final]

```

Edit the generated **tile.yml** file to define your tile.

```

Build the tile.
```

tile build [version]

```
The build command will generate the **product** folder which contains the deployable *.pivotal tile file and all the artifacts that tile required. A new product tile yaml file **[product name].yml** will also created under the **product/metadata/** based on the tile.yml you edited above. The related properties will be redefined by the generator.

**NOTES: The generated yml file may include some properties related with Pivotal Elastic Runtime (always start with ..cf). If your deployment is built on BOSH release, that means it does not depend on Pivotal Elastic Runtime, you can remove those properties. Otherwise, the deployment will be definitely failed.**

There is also an **alternative** way to build the tile package.
Open the **harbor-tile.yml** file under product/metadata, replace the following template variables with the real values:
```
{{product_version}} ##product version with format x.x.x

{{bosh_release_file}} ##File name of your bosh release tarball under the releases folder

{{bosh_release_name}} ##The name of the bosh release

{{bosh_release_version}} ##The version of the bosh release
```

Then create the tile package with zip command:
```
cd product

zip -r harbor-x.x.x.pivotal metadata migrations releases
```


You can import the generated Harbor tile file which is located in the **product** folder into the ops manager to try the product deployment.
![import product](resources/ops-manager.png)

Configure the Harbor.
![import product](resources/config.png)

Check the status after a successfully deployment.
![import product](resources/status_check.png)
